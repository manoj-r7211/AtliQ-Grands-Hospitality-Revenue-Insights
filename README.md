# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis

## Project Overview
**Domain:** Hospitality  
**Function:** Revenue Management  

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been a key player in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making, AtliQ Grands has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.

To regain their market share and improve revenue, the management decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence. As they lacked an in-house data analytics team, they hired a third-party service provider to derive insights from their historical data. This project aims to provide actionable insights to the revenue management team through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Dashboard Description
The dashboard consists of three key pages, each designed to provide unique insights:

1. **Overview Page:**
   - Provides a high-level view of key hospitality metrics, trends, and performance highlights.
   - Visuals Used: Bar Charts, Table Visuals, Donut Charts.

2. **Revenue & Occupancy Analysis:**
   - Analyzes revenue streams, booking trends, and occupancy rates to identify factors impacting hotel performance.
   - Highlights key metrics like Total Revenue, Average Daily Revenue, Average Rating, Occupancy %, and Revenue per Available Room.
   - KPI Cards compare current metrics with the previous month, showing percentage changes.

3. **Guest Experience & Performance:**
   - Focuses on guest feedback, ratings, and service quality to enhance customer experience and operational excellence.

## Key Learnings
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:**
  - Engaged with stakeholders to gather business requirements and understand key metrics crucial to their decision-making.
  - Learned the importance of asking the right questions to avoid making assumptions and ensure the dashboard addresses real business needs.
- **Business-Centric Approach:**
  - Focused not only on what stakeholders requested but also identified additional insights that could benefit the business.
- **New Visuals Implemented:**
  - **Calendar Matrix Visual:** Used conditional formatting to create a heat map effect, with colors representing low, medium, and high revenue values across different days.
  - **Scatter Plot:** Compared Occupancy % with Average Rating across various properties to identify performance patterns.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Modeling** to establish relationships between datasets.
